## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Wood, an aspiring IT professional with a foundation in Rust and experience across multiple programming languages. I'm passionate about learning, creating, and contributing to software engineering projects.

  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on gathering up certifications to buff my resume up, and working on projects that will do the same.

  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Python, JavaScript, and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure. Quite a lot of items are on my dart board of productive things to learn more of.

  ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve Rust, web development, or creative software engineering.

  ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with gaining more experience in cloud computing and large-scale application development. I'm always open to mentorship opportunities or advice on starting an IT career.

  ðŸ¦€ I enjoy Rust, productivity hacks, and building tools for creative problem-solving.
  Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or drop me a message via email. ðŸ“«
  
  I also enjoy playing games like *Factorio*, *Minecraft*, *OpenTTD*, and *Valheim* on rare occasions.
