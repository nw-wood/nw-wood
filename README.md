## Howdy ðŸ¤ 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Wood, an aspiring IT professional with a foundation in Rust and experience across multiple programming languages. I'm passionate about learning, creating, and contributing to software engineering projects. Iâ€™m currently working on gathering up certifications to buff my resume up, and working on projects that will do the same. While doing that I'm learning more Rust, React, some MongoDB, some PostgreSQL, a bit of Python, a sprinkle of JavaScript, and potentially some cloud technologies like AWS and Azure as I go.

Always open to mentorship opportunities or advice on starting an IT career.

Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or drop me a message via email. ðŸ“«
  
I also enjoy playing games like *Factorio: Space Age*, *OpenTTD*, and *Valheim* on rare occasions.
